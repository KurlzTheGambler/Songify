Developed a C++ application that mimicked a streaming service for music called Songify. The project 
involved creating 8 classes including Song, Album, SongArray, AlbumArray, Songify, Client, 
TestControl, and TestView. These classes represented the entity objects, collection objects, control
objects, and boundary objects, respectively. The Songify network consisted of Albums that contained
songs, and the Client class was able to connect to the Songify network to stream songs or download 
albums. The TestControl class controlled the running of tests on the application, and the TestView 
class took input from the user performing the tests.
